## Ahoy hoy! I'm Sam.

I am learning that I have so much to learn! Luckily, I love learning - but I hate feeling stupid. This is all new to me and I ask a **lot** of questions, so I apologize in advance.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a software engineering student at Flatiron. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning that I'm not as savvy as I thought I was.
